Recoil:

State management package

first lesson:



- my first experience using recoil
after genarating a new react-js application with 19.1.0 version, and install recoil package, the default installing package was version 0.7.7
the integration with the package was giving this error with using the recoil hooks to get value or state
(Cannot destructure property 'ReactCurrentDispatcher' of 'react.__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED' as it is undefined.)

after searching for thsi error and the cause of it I find out that the problem was with the default genarated react version as it is unstable version,
couldn't go aline with the recoil package.
